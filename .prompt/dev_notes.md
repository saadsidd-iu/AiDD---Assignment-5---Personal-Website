Create a separate CSS fill linked from each HTML page. Ensure consistency with fonts, colors and layouts across pages. Use semantic HTML for structure.

Add a form on the contact html page. Fields: - First Name (required) - Last Name (required) - Email Address (required, valid format) - Password (required, min 8 characters) - Confirm Password (required, must match Password) - Use attributes: required, type, pattern, minlength. - Show clear error messages (using HTML or minimal JavaScript). - Redirect to a Thank You page (thankyou.html) after submission. - Accessibility requirement: All inputs must have labels connected with for and id. Add alt text for any images

## Update 2: PDF Path Fix

**Issue:** Resume PDF was not displaying in the PDF viewer due to incorrect file path.

**Problem:** The path `../Files & Inspiration/Siddique_Saad_Resume.pdf` was trying to access a file outside the Flask static directory, which Flask cannot serve directly.

**Solution:**
1. Copied the PDF file from "Files & Inspiration" folder to the "static" folder
2. Updated all PDF references in resume.html to use the correct Flask static path
3. Changed from `{{ url_for('static', filename='../Files & Inspiration/Siddique_Saad_Resume.pdf') }}` to `{{ url_for('static', filename='Siddique_Saad_Resume.pdf') }}`

**Files Updated:**
- `templates/resume.html` - Updated iframe src and download link paths
